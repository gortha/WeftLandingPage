# Static Export Deployment Guide

## ✅ Configuration Status

Your Weft Finance V2 landing page has been successfully configured for static export with the following settings:

### Next.js Configuration (`next.config.ts`)
- ✅ `output: 'export'` - Enables static site generation
- ✅ `distDir: 'dist'` - Sets output directory to `dist`
- ✅ Headers and redirects commented out (not compatible with static export)
- ✅ API route configured with `dynamic: 'force-static'`

### Build Results
- ✅ **83 files** generated in `dist` directory
- ✅ **Static HTML** generated for all pages
- ✅ **Assets** properly copied and optimized
- ✅ **API health endpoint** exported as static JSON

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: GitHub Pages
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to repository Settings → Pages
3. Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
4. Select `main` branch and `/dist` folder
5. Your site will be available at `https://username.github.io/repository-name`

### Option 2: Netlify
1. Drag and drop the `dist` folder to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
2. Or connect your GitHub repository and set:
   - Build command: `pnpm build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`

### Option 3: Vercel (Static)
1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Run: `vercel --prod` from the project root
3. Vercel will automatically detect the static export

### Option 4: Cloudflare Pages
1. Connect your GitHub repository
2. Set build command: `pnpm build`
3. Set output directory: `dist`

### Option 5: Custom Server
Upload the `dist` folder contents to any web server that can serve static files.

## 🔧 Build Commands

```bash
# Development
pnpm dev

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Test the static build locally
npx serve dist -l 3000
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **API Routes**: The health endpoint is now static JSON and won't update dynamically
2. **Redirects**: Custom redirects don't work with static export - handle them at the hosting level
3. **Headers**: Security headers need to be configured at the hosting level
4. **Image Optimization**: Images are served statically without Next.js optimization

## 🌐 Live Testing

The exported site includes:
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ All animations and interactions
- ✅ Static data fallbacks
- ✅ SEO metadata
- ✅ PWA manifest
- ✅ All assets and images

Your Weft Finance V2 landing page is now ready for deployment to any static hosting platform! 🎉
